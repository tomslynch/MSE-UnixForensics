## Description:
This program targets a single process and records all system calls invoked by that process. After you input the process
ID the program will continue auditing until the program is terminated. The program will output a report of the audit
named with the filename entered on startup, or with a timestamp, to the same directory. The report contains a
timestamped list of all the system calls from the target process.

The group option will restrict the system calls recorded based on a pre-defined list of groups stored in
config/modes.txt. Each group is listed with the name and flag delimited by a colon as the first line and the categorized
system calls on it's separate line below. Each group is then delimited by a blank line. Therefore any custom group or
categorization can be added/edited.
